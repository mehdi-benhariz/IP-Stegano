# IP-Stegano

IP-Stegano is a Python project that allows users to hide text messages inside images using the least significant bit (LSB) technique. The project is developed using the OpenCV and NumPy libraries.

## Description

The project provides a command-line interface that allows users to encode a text message into an image and decode a text message from an encoded image. The encoded image looks the same as the original image to the human eye and can be shared over public channels.

The project has some sample images that can be used for testing purposes. However, users can also use their own images.

## Installation

To use IP-Stegano, you need to have Python 3 and some other packages installed. These packages can be easily installed by running the `install.sh` script.

Note: The `install.sh` script assumes that you have Python 3 installed on your system.

To install the required packages, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to make the `install.sh` script executable:

`chmod +x install.sh`

4. Run the following command to install the required packages:

`./install.sh`

his will install the required packages using `pip`, a Python package installer.

## Presentation

A brief Presentation was made to facilitate to clarify the project. You can find it in the [PDF file](/Image%20Steganography.pdf).
